# NavigationStacks-BLOG-API-React-Native

React Native Blog App
This project was created as part of the React Native learning process. It utilizes Expo, React Navigation, React Stacks, and Fetch to consume data from the JsonPlaceholder API. The app consists of three screens connected through a stack. The first screen displays a list of all users from the API. When a user is selected, the app fetches all posts and filters them by the user's ID. The app then displays all posts in a list on the second screen. Finally, the third screen displays the title, body, and user of the selected post.

Please note that certain uses of  **`getParam`** could potentially be improved through the use of a component or Redux. However, for the purpose of this exercise in API usage and stack navigation,  **`getParam`** was implemented as is.
